# ðŸš€ Advanced Python Programming

This repository contains programs and hands-on exercises from the **Advanced Python Workshop** conducted during my **second semester** at **NIET College**.  
The workshop focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and introduced powerful **Python libraries** for data analysis and scientific computing.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

### ðŸ§± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Inheritance and Method Overriding
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### ðŸ“š Python Libraries
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computing with arrays
- **Pandas** â€“ DataFrames, series, data manipulation
- **SciPy** â€“ Scientific and technical computing (e.g., integration, optimization)
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization (line plots, bar charts, etc.)
